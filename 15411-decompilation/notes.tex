\section{Introduction}
In this lecture, we consider the problem of doing compilation ``backwards'' - that is,
transforming from a compiled binary into a reasonable representation of its original
source. Solving this problem will involve significant consideration of our standard
dataflow analyses, as well as a discussion of good selection of internal representations
of code.

While the motivation for the existence of compilers is fairly clear, the motivation
for the existence of {\em decompilers} is less so. However, in the modern world there
exist {\em many} legacy systems for which the original source code has been lost, 
which need bugs fixed in them or to be ported to a more modern architecture. Decompilers
facilitate this process greatly. In addition, in malware analysis, generally source
is not provided. It is therefore extremely useful to have some way to go from binary
to a reasonable approximation of the original code.

\section{Steps of Decompilation}
Roughly, decompilation follows a few steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Disassembly - transformation from machine code to the assembly equivalent. There
are a surprising number of pitfalls here.
\item Lifting and dataflow analysis - transforming the resulting assembly code into a
higher-level internal representation, such as our three-operand assembly. One of the
tricky parts here is recognizing distinct variables, and detaching variables from
registers or addresses. We also recover expressions, function return values and arguments.
\item Control flow analysis - recovering control flow structure information, such as
if and while statements, as well as their nesting level.
\item Type analysis - recovering types of variables, functions, and other pieces
of data.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Disassembly}
The first step of writing a good decompiler is writing a good disassembler. While the
details of individual disassemblers can be extremely complex, the general idea is 
fairly simple. The mapping between assembly and machine code is in theory one-to-one,
so a straight-line translation should be feasible.

However, disassemblers rapidly run into a problem: it is {\em very difficult}
to reliably distinguish code from data.

In order to do so, generally disassemblers will take one of two strategies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Disassemble the sections that are generally filled with code (\verb+.plt+, \verb+.text+,
some others) and treat the rest of them as data. One tool that follows this strategy is 
\verb+objdump+. While this works decently well on code produced by most modern compilers,
there exist (or existed!) compilers that place data into these executable sections, causing
the disassembler some confusion. Further, any confusingly-aligned instructions will also
confuse these disassemblers.
\item Consider the starting address given by the binary's header, and recursively disassemble
all code reachable from that address. This approach is frequently defeated by indirect jumps,
though most of the disassemblers that use it have additional heuristics that allow them to
deal with this. An example tool that follows this strategy is Hex-Ray's Interactive Disassembler.
\end{enumerate}

While disassembly is a difficult problem with many pitfalls, it is not particularly interesting
from an implementation perspective for us. Many program ``obfuscators'' have many steps that
are targeted at fooling disassemblers, however, as without correct disassembly it is impossible
to carry on the later steps.
\section{Lifting and Dataflow Analysis}
Given correct disassembly, another problem rears its head. As you may have noticed while
writing your compilers, doing any form of reasonable analysis on x86\_64 is an exercise
in futility. The structure of most assembly language does not lend itself well to any kind
of sophisticated analysis.

In order to deal with this, decompilers generally do something which closely resembles 
a backwards form of instruction selection. However, decompilers cannot just tile sequences
of assembly instructions with sequences of abstract instructions, as different compilers
may produce radically different assembly for the same sequence of abstract instructions.

Further, frequently a single abstract instruction can expand into a very long sequence of ``real''
instructions, many of which are optimized away by the compiler later on.

There are two primary approaches to dealing with this issue. The first is to simply
translate our complex x86\_64 into a simpler RISC instruction set. The tools produced by
Zynamics frequently take this approach. The alternative is to translate into an exactly
semantics-preserving, perhaps more complicated, instruction set, which has more cross-platform
ways of performing analysis on it. This is the approach taken by CMU's BAP research project,
as well as by the Hex-Rays decompiler.

The choice of the internal representation can be very important. For our purposes, we'll consider
the $3$-operand IR that we've been using throughout the semester.

We will summarize the translation from x86\_64 to our IR by simply
effectively doing instruction selection in reverse. The difficulty here is
generally in the design of the IR, which we most likely do not have the time to
discuss in detail. Some places to learn about IRs include the BAP website 
(\verb+bap.ece.cmu.edu+) and the Zynamics paper ``REIL: A platform-independent
intermediate representation of disassembled code for static code analysis'' by
Thomas Dullien and Sebastian Porst.

Once we have obtained an IR, we would now like to eliminate as many details 
about the underlying machine as possible. This is generally done using a 
form of dataflow analysis, in order to recover variables, expressions and 
the straight-line statements.

\section{Control Flow Analysis}
Having reached this stage, we now have a reasonable control flow graph, with ``real'' variables
in it. At this point, we {\em could} produce C code which is semantically equivalent to the
original machine code. However, this is frequently undesirable. Few programs are written with
as much abuse of the \verb+goto+ keyword as this approach would entail. Most control flow graphs
are generated by {\em structured} programs, using \verb+if+, \verb+for+ and \verb+while+. It
is then desirable for the decompiler to attempt to recover this original structure and arrive
at a fair approximation of the original code.

This form of analysis relies largely on graph transformations. A primary element of this analysis
relies on considering {\em dominator} nodes. Given a start node $a$, a node $b$ is said to 
dominate a node $c$ if every path from $a$ to $c$ in the graph passes through $b$. The 
{\em immediate dominator} of $c$ is the node $b$ such that for every node $d$, if $d$ dominates
$c$, then either $d = b$ or $d$ dominates $b$.

\subsection{Structuring Loops}
We will consider three primary different classes of loops. While other loops may appear
in decompiled code, analysis of these more complex loops is more difficult. Further reading can
be found in the paper ``A Structuring Algorithm for Decompilation'' by Cristina Cifuentes.
Our three primary classes are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em While loops}: the node at the start of the loop is a conditional,
	and the latching node is unconditional.
\item {\em Repeat loops}: the latching node is conditional.
\item {\em Endless loops}: both the latching and the start nodes are unconditional.
\end{enumerate}
The {\em latching node} here is the node with the back-edge to the start node.
We note that there are at most {\em one of these} per loop in our language, as \verb+break+
and \verb+continue+ do not exist.

In order to do so, we will consider {\em intervals} on a digraph. If $h$ is a node in $G$,
the interval $I(h)$ is the maximal subgraph in which $h$ is the only entry node and 
in which all closed paths contain $h$. It is a theorem that there exists a set 
$\{h_1, ... h_k\}$ of header nodes such that the set $\{ I(h_1), ... I(h_k) \}$ is
a partition of the graph, and further there exists an algorithm to find this partition.

We then define the sequence of {\em derived graphs} of $G$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G^1 = G$.
\item $G^{n+1}$ is the graph formed by contracting every interval of $G^n$ into a single node.
\end{enumerate}
This procedure eventually reaches a fixed point, at which point the resulting graph is
{\em irreducible}.

Note that for any interval $I(h)$, there exists a loop rooted at $h$ if there is a back-edge
to $h$ from some node $z \in I(h)$. One way to find such a node is to simply perform DFS
on the interval. Then, in order to find the nodes in the loop, we define $h$ as being part of
the loop and then proceed by noting that a node $k$ is in the loop if and only if its immediate
dominator is in the loop.

The algorithm for finding loops in the graph then proceeds as follows.
Compute the derived graphs of $G$ until you reach the fixed point, and find the loops in each
derived graph. Note that if any node is found to be the latching node for {\em two} loops,
one of these loops will need to be labeled with a goto instead. While there do exist algorithms
that can recover more complex structures, this is not one of them.
\subsection{Structuring Ifs}
An {\em if} statement is a $2$-way conditional branch with a common end node. 
The final end node is referred to as the {\em follow} node and is immediately dominated
by the header node.

First, compute a post-ordering of the graph, and traverse it in that order. This guarantees
that we will analyze inner nested ifs before outer ones.

We now find if statements as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every conditional node $a$,
find the set of nodes immediately dominated by $a$.
\item Produce $G'$ from $G$ by
reversing all the arrows. Filter out nodes from the set above that do 
not dominate $a$ in $G'$.
\item Find the closest node to $a$ 
in the resulting set, by considering
the one with the highest post-order
number.
\end{enumerate}
The resulting node is the {\em follow} node of $a$.
\section{Type Analysis}
Given control flow and some idea of which variables are which, it is frequently useful to be
able to determine what the {\em types} of various variables are. While it may be correct
to produce a result where every variable is of type \verb+void *+, no one actually writes
programs that way. Therefore, we would like to be able to assign variables and functions their
types, as well as hopefully recover structure layout.

A compiler has significant advantages over a decompiler in this respect. The compiler knows
which sections of a structure are padding, and which are actually useful; it also knows which
things a function can take or accept. A compiler notices that the functions below are 
different, and so compiles them separately; a decompiler may not be able to notice that these
functions accept different types without some more sophisticated analysis. In particular, 
on a 32-bit machine, these functions will produce {\em identical} assembly.

\begin{verbatim}
struct s1 { int a; };
int s1_get(struct s1 *s) { return s->a; }
struct s2 { struct s1 *a; };
struct s1 *s2_get(struct s2 *s) { return s->a; }
\end{verbatim}

Given this problem, how does type analysis work?

\section{Other Issues}
Other issues that haven't been discussed here include doing things like automatically detecting
vulnerabilities, detecting and possibly collapsing aliases, recovering scoping information, extracting inlined functions, or dealing
with tail call optimizations. Many of these problems (and, in fact, many of the things discussed
above!) do not have satisfactory solutions, and remain open research problems. 
For one, CMU's CyLab contains a group actively doing research on these topics.
