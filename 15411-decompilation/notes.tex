\section{Introduction}
In this lecture, we consider the problem of doing compilation ``backwards'' - that is,
transforming from a compiled binary into a reasonable representation of its original
source. Solving this problem will involve significant consideration of our standard
dataflow analyses, as well as a discussion of good selection of internal representations
of code.

While the motivation for the existence of compilers is fairly clear, the motivation
for the existence of {\em decompilers} is less so. However, in the modern world there
exist {\em many} legacy systems for which the original source code has been lost, 
which need bugs fixed in them or to be ported to a more modern architecture. Decompilers
facilitate this process greatly. In addition, in malware analysis, generally source
is not provided. It is therefore extremely useful to have some way to go from binary
to a reasonable approximation of the original code.

For this lecture, we will focus on decompiling machine code, originally C0 code,
that conforms to the C ABI, into a version of C0 with pointer arithmetic
and \verb+goto+. This comes {\em nowhere near} to being a treatment of
decompilation of arbitrary binaries, though (generally more complex) variants of
the same ideas will continue to work.

\section{Steps of Decompilation}
Roughly, decompilation follows a few steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Disassembly - transformation from machine code to the assembly equivalent. There
are a surprising number of pitfalls here.
\item Lifting and dataflow analysis - transforming the resulting assembly code into a
higher-level internal representation, such as our three-operand assembly. One of the
tricky parts here is recognizing distinct variables, and detaching variables from
registers or addresses. We also recover expressions, function return values and arguments.
\item Control flow analysis - recovering control flow structure information, such as
if and while statements, as well as their nesting level.
\item Type analysis - recovering types of variables, functions, and other pieces
of data.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Disassembly}
The first step of writing a good decompiler is writing a good disassembler. While the
details of individual disassemblers can be extremely complex, the general idea is 
fairly simple. The mapping between assembly and machine code is in theory one-to-one,
so a straight-line translation should be feasible.

However, disassemblers rapidly run into a problem: it is {\em very difficult}
to reliably distinguish code from data.

In order to do so, generally disassemblers will take one of two strategies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Disassemble the sections that are generally filled with code (\verb+.plt+, \verb+.text+,
some others) and treat the rest of them as data. One tool that follows this strategy is 
\verb+objdump+. While this works decently well on code produced by most modern compilers,
there exist (or existed!) compilers that place data into these executable sections, causing
the disassembler some confusion. Further, any confusingly-aligned instructions will also
confuse these disassemblers.
\item Consider the starting address given by the binary's header, and recursively disassemble
all code reachable from that address. This approach is frequently defeated by indirect jumps,
though most of the disassemblers that use it have additional heuristics that allow them to
deal with this. An example tool that follows this strategy is Hex-Ray's Interactive Disassembler.
\end{enumerate}

While disassembly is a difficult problem with many pitfalls, it is not particularly interesting
from an implementation perspective for us. Many program ``obfuscators'' have many steps that
are targeted at fooling disassemblers, however, as without correct disassembly it is impossible
to carry on the later steps.
\section{Lifting and Dataflow Analysis}
Given correct disassembly, another problem rears its head. As you may have noticed while
writing your compilers, doing any form of reasonable analysis on x86\_64 is an exercise
in futility. The structure of most assembly language does not lend itself well to any kind
of sophisticated analysis.

In order to deal with this, decompilers generally do something which closely resembles 
a backwards form of instruction selection. However, decompilers cannot just tile sequences
of assembly instructions with sequences of abstract instructions, as different compilers
may produce radically different assembly for the same sequence of abstract instructions.

Further, frequently a single abstract instruction can expand into a very long sequence of ``real''
instructions, many of which are optimized away by the compiler later on.

There are two primary approaches to dealing with this issue. The first is to simply
translate our complex x86\_64 into a simpler RISC instruction set. The tools produced by
Zynamics frequently take this approach. The alternative is to translate into an exactly
semantics-preserving, perhaps more complicated, instruction set, which has more cross-platform
ways of performing analysis on it. This is the approach taken by CMU's BAP research project,
as well as by the Hex-Rays decompiler.

The choice of the internal representation can be very important. For our purposes,
we'll consider a modified version of the $3$-operand IR that we've been using
throughout the semester. We'll consider a version that is extended to allow
instructions of the form \verb+s <- e+ where \verb+e+ is an expression.

We will summarize the translation from x86\_64 to our IR by simply
effectively doing instruction selection in reverse. The difficulty here is
generally in the design of the IR, which we most likely do not have the time to
discuss in detail. Some places to learn about IRs include the BAP website 
(\verb+bap.ece.cmu.edu+) and the Zynamics paper ``REIL: A platform-independent
intermediate representation of disassembled code for static code analysis'' by
Thomas Dullien and Sebastian Porst.

Once we have obtained an IR, we would now like to eliminate as many details 
about the underlying machine as possible. This is generally done using a 
form of dataflow analysis, in order to recover variables, expressions and 
the straight-line statements.

Recall the dataflow analyses that have been presented in past lectures. Many of
these analyses will be available to help us ``refactor'' the IR produced by
our direct translation.

We will follow two preliminary analyses, both of which are predicated on liveness
analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dead register elimination. This is necessary to efficiently deal with
	instructions such as \verb+idiv+, as well as to notice \verb+void+ functions.
	It should be noted that unlike in your compilers, it is {\em sometimes} 
	possible to eliminate instructions with additional state.
	For example, if \verb+idiv %ecx+ translates into:
	\begin{verbatim}
		t <- %edx:%eax
		%eax <- t / %ecx
		%edx <- t % %ecx
	\end{verbatim}
	and \verb+%eax+ is not live in the successor, {\em it is permissible} 
	to remove the second line of the result, since the third line will
	cause the division by $0$ in the case that \verb+%ecx+ is zero.
	
	Dead register elimination is done following effectively the same
	rules as dead code elimination from the homeworks, with some special
	cases like the above.
\item Dead flag elimination. Our translation makes direct use of the condition
	flags, and keeps track of which of them are defined and used at which time.
	We treat flags effectively as registers of their own. In this case,
	if a flag $f$ is defined at a line $l$ and is not live-in in $l+1$,
	then we remove the definition of $f$ from the line $l$. This will
	simplify our later analyses greatly, allowing us to collapse conditions
	more effectively.
\item Conditional collapsing. At this stage, we collapse sequences of the form
	comparison-cjump into a conditional jump on an expression.
	For example, after flag elimination, we collapse:
	\begin{verbatim}
		zf <- cmp(%eax,0)
		jz label
	\end{verbatim}
	into
	\begin{verbatim}
		jcond (%eax == 0) label
	\end{verbatim}
	In C0, generally every conditional will have this form. However, sufficiently
	clever optimizing compilers may be able to optimize some conditional chains
	more efficiently. A discussion of transforming more optimized conditions
	can be found in Cristina Cifuentes' thesis.
\end{enumerate}

Having reached this point in the analysis, we would like to lose registers.
Hence, we may simply replace each register with an appropriate temp,
{\em taking care to keep argument and result registers pinned}. We then
do the function-call-expansion step in reverse, replacing sequences of moves into argument
registers followed by a call with a parametrized call. We note that in order to do so,
we must first make a pass over all functions to determine how many arguments they take,
in order to deal with the possibility of certain moves being optimized out.

At this stage, it is possible to effectively perform a slightly modified SSA analysis
on the resulting code. Hence, for the future we will assume that this SSA analysis has been
executed, and define our further analysis over SSA code.
We may now perform an extended copy-propagation pass to collapse expressions.

This is sufficient to perform the next stages of the analysis. However, many decompilers
apply much more sophisticated techniques to this stage. Cristina Cifuentes' thesis contains
a description of many such algorithms.

\section{Control Flow Analysis}
Having reached this stage, we now have a reasonable control flow graph, with ``real'' variables
in it. At this point, we {\em could} produce C code which is semantically equivalent to the
original machine code. However, this is frequently undesirable. Few programs are written with
as much abuse of the \verb+goto+ keyword as this approach would entail. Most control flow graphs
are generated by {\em structured} programs, using \verb+if+, \verb+for+ and \verb+while+. It
is then desirable for the decompiler to attempt to recover this original structure and arrive
at a fair approximation of the original code.

This form of analysis relies largely on graph transformations. A primary element of this analysis
relies on considering {\em dominator} nodes. Given a start node $a$, a node $b$ is said to 
dominate a node $c$ if every path from $a$ to $c$ in the graph passes through $b$. The 
{\em immediate dominator} of $c$ is the node $b$ such that for every node $d$, if $d$ dominates
$c$, then either $d = b$ or $d$ dominates $b$.

\subsection{Structuring Loops}
We will consider three primary different classes of loops. While other loops may appear
in decompiled code, analysis of these more complex loops is more difficult. Further reading can
be found in the paper ``A Structuring Algorithm for Decompilation'' by Cristina Cifuentes.
Our three primary classes are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em While loops}: the node at the start of the loop is a conditional,
	and the latching node is unconditional.
\item {\em Repeat loops}: the latching node is conditional.
\item {\em Endless loops}: both the latching and the start nodes are unconditional.
\end{enumerate}
The {\em latching node} here is the node with the back-edge to the start node.
We note that there are at most {\em one of these} per loop in our language, as \verb+break+
and \verb+continue+ do not exist.

In order to do so, we will consider {\em intervals} on a digraph. If $h$ is a node in $G$,
the interval $I(h)$ is the maximal subgraph in which $h$ is the only entry node and 
in which all closed paths contain $h$. It is a theorem that there exists a set 
$\{h_1, ... h_k\}$ of header nodes such that the set $\{ I(h_1), ... I(h_k) \}$ is
a partition of the graph, and further there exists an algorithm to find this partition.

We then define the sequence of {\em derived graphs} of $G$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G^1 = G$.
\item $G^{n+1}$ is the graph formed by contracting every interval of $G^n$ into a single node.
\end{enumerate}
This procedure eventually reaches a fixed point, at which point the resulting graph is
{\em irreducible}.

Note that for any interval $I(h)$, there exists a loop rooted at $h$ if there is a back-edge
to $h$ from some node $z \in I(h)$. One way to find such a node is to simply perform DFS
on the interval. Then, in order to find the nodes in the loop, we define $h$ as being part of
the loop and then proceed by noting that a node $k$ is in the loop if and only if its immediate
dominator is in the loop.

The algorithm for finding loops in the graph then proceeds as follows.
Compute the derived graphs of $G$ until you reach the fixed point, and find the loops in each
derived graph. Note that if any node is found to be the latching node for {\em two} loops,
one of these loops will need to be labeled with a goto instead. While there do exist algorithms
that can recover more complex structures, this is not one of them.
\subsection{Structuring Ifs}
An {\em if} statement is a $2$-way conditional branch with a common end node. 
The final end node is referred to as the {\em follow} node and is immediately dominated
by the header node.

First, compute a post-ordering of the graph, and traverse it in that order. This guarantees
that we will analyze inner nested ifs before outer ones.

We now find if statements as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every conditional node $a$,
find the set of nodes immediately dominated by $a$.
\item Produce $G'$ from $G$ by
reversing all the arrows. Filter out nodes from the set above that do 
not dominate $a$ in $G'$.
\item Find the closest node to $a$ 
in the resulting set, by considering
the one with the highest post-order
number.
\end{enumerate}
The resulting node is the {\em follow} node of $a$.

We note that this algorithm does not do a particularly good job of dealing
with boolean short-circuiting.

Any control flow that does not match the patterns above will be replaced
with a \verb+goto+.
\section{Type Analysis}
Given control flow and some idea of which variables are which, it is frequently useful to be
able to determine what the {\em types} of various variables are. While it may be correct
to produce a result where every variable is of type \verb+void *+, no one actually writes
programs that way. Therefore, we would like to be able to assign variables and functions their
types, as well as hopefully recover structure layout.

A compiler has significant advantages over a decompiler in this respect. The compiler knows
which sections of a structure are padding, and which are actually useful; it also knows which
things a function can take or accept. A compiler notices that the functions below are 
different, and so compiles them separately; a decompiler may not be able to notice that these
functions accept different types without some more sophisticated analysis. In particular, 
on a 32-bit machine, these functions will produce {\em identical} assembly.

\begin{verbatim}
struct s1 { int a; };
int s1_get(struct s1 *s) { return s->a; }
struct s2 { struct s1 *a; };
struct s1 *s2_get(struct s2 *s) { return s->a; }
\end{verbatim}

Given this problem, how does type analysis work?

In short, the answer is: this is an open problem. The TIE paper by CyLab claims to resolve
many such cases, but is far from complete. The Hex-Rays decompiler fails to recognize structures
altogether, and often defaults to \verb+int+ even when the variable is in fact a pointer.

We can model a simple type analysis as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiplication, substraction, shifting, xor, binary and, binary or
	and division force their ``parameters'' to be integers.
\item Dereferencing forces its parameter to be a pointer.
\item The return values of standard library functions are maintained.
\item Any variable that is branched on is a boolean.
\item If two variables are added together and one is a pointer, the other is an integer.
\item If two variables are added together and one is an integer, the other is either a pointer
	or an integer.
\item If two variables are compared with \verb+<+, \verb+>+, \verb+>=+ or \verb+<=+,
	they are both integers.
\item If two variables are compared with \verb+==+ or \verb+!=+, they have the same type.
\item If something is returned from \verb+main()+, it is an integer.
\item If the value of one variable is moved into another variable, they have the same type.
\item If the dereferenced value of a pointer has type $\tau$, then the pointer has type
	$\tau^*$.
\item The sum of a pointer of type $\tau^*$ and an integer is a pointer, but not necessarily
of type $\tau^*$.
\end{enumerate}

We note that in order to get high-quality types, we will often need to perform analysis across
function boundaries. We also note that this analysis is entirely unable to distinguish between
structures and arrays. A more sophisticated type analysis is described in the TIE paper 
in the references section. There is plenty of research being done in this area, however!
\section{Other Issues}
Other issues that haven't been discussed here include doing things like automatically detecting
vulnerabilities, detecting and possibly collapsing aliases, recovering scoping information,
extracting inlined functions, or dealing with tail call optimizations. Many of these problems (and,
in fact, many of the things discussed above!) do not have satisfactory solutions, and remain open
research problems. For one, CMU's CyLab contains a group actively doing research on these topics.

Decompilation as a whole is very much an open research topic, and there exist very few reasonable
decompilers. One of the better-known ones is the Hex-Rays decompiler, and it is sadly entirely
closed-source. As far as I know, there are {\em no} high-quality open-source decompilers
for x86 or x86\_64.
